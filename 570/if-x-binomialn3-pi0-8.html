<p>Example 8. Suppose a bird survey only captures the presence or absence of a particular bird (say the mountain chickadee). Assuming the true presence proportion at national forest sites around Flagstaff =0.1 , then for n=20 randomly chosen sites, the number of sites in which the bird was observed would have the distribution&lt;&lt;fig.height=2.5, fig.width=5&gt;&gt;=</p>
<p>Often we are interested in questions such as P(X2) which is the probability that we see 2 or fewer of the sites being occupied by mountain chickadee. These calculations can be tedious to calculate by hand but R will calculate these cumulative distribution function values for you using the “p-function”. This cumulative distribution function gives the sum of all values up to and including the number given.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;=</p>
<p>In general we will be interested in asking four different questions about a distribution.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>What is the height of the probability mass function (or probability density function). For discrete variable Y this is P(Y=y) for whatever value of y we want. In R, this will be the d-function.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the probability of observing a value less than or equal to y ? In other words, to calculate P(Yy) . In R, this will be the p-function.</p></li>
<li><p>What is a particular quantile of a distribution? For example, what value separates the lower 25% from the upper 75%? In R, this will be the q-function.</p></li>
<li><p>Generate a random sample of values from a specified distribution. In R, this will be the r-function.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>1.4.2 Poisson Distribution</p>
<p>A commonly used distribution for count data is the Poisson.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Number of customers arriving over a 5 minute interval</p></li>
<li><p>Number of birds observed during a 10 minute listening period</p></li>
<li><p>Number of prairie dog towns per 1000 hectares</p></li>
<li><p>Number of alga clumps per cubic meter of lake water</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For a RV is a Poisson RV if the following conditions apply:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Two or more events do not occur at precisely the same time or in the same space</p></li>
<li><p>The occurrence of an event in a given period of time or region of space is independent of the occurrence of the event in a non overlapping period or region.</p></li>
<li><p>The expected number of events during one period or region,  , is the same in all periods or regions of the same size.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming that these conditions hold for some count variable Y , the the probability mass function is given byP(Y=y)= where  is the expected number of events over 1 unit of time or space and e is the constant 2.718281828 .</p>
<p>E[Y] = Var[Y] = </p>
<p>Example 9. Suppose we are interested in the population size of small mammals in a region. Let Y be the number of small mammals caught in a large trap (multiple traps in the same location?) in a 12 hour period. Finally, suppose that YPoi(=2.3) . What is the probability of finding exactly 4 critters in our trap?P(Y=4) =  = 0.1169 What about the probability of finding at most 4?P(Y4) = P(Y=0)+P(Y=1)+P(Y=2)+P(Y=3)+P(Y=4) = 0.1003+0.2306+0.2652+0.2033+0.1169 = 0.9163</p>
<p>What about the probability of finding 5 or more?P(Y5) = 1-P(Y4) = 1-0.9163 = 0.0837 These calculations can be done using the distribution function (d-function) for the poisson and the cumulative distribution function (p-function).</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;fig.height=3, fig.width=6&gt;&gt;=</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;=</p>
<p>1.5 Continuous Random Variables</p>
<p>Finding the area under the curve of a particular density function f(x) requires the use of calculus, but since this isn’t a calculus course, we will resort to using R or tables of calculated values.</p>
<p>1.5.1 Uniform(0,1) Distribution</p>
<p>Suppose you wish to draw a random number number between 0 and 1 and each number should have an equal chance of being selected. This random variable is said to have a Uniform(0,1) distribution.</p>
<p>Because there are an infinite number of rational numbers between 0 and 1, the probability of any particular number being selected is 1/=0 . But even though each number has 0 probability of being selected, some number must end up being selected. Because of this conundrum, probability theory doesn’t look at the probability of a single number, but rather focuses on a region of numbers.</p>
<p>To make this distinction, we will define the distribution using a probability density function instead of the probability mass function. In the discrete case, we had to constrain the probability mass function to sum to 1. In the continuous case, we have to constrain the probability density function to integrate to 1.</p>
<p>&lt;<echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=6>&gt;=</p>
<p>Finding the area under the curve of a particular density function f(x) usually requires the use of calculus, but since this isn’t a calculus course, we will resort to using R or tables of calculated values.</p>
<p>1.5.2 Exponential Distribution</p>
<p>The exponential distribution is the continuous analog of the Poisson distribution and is often used to model the time between occurrence of successive events. Perhaps we are modeling time between transmissions on a network, or the time between feeding events or prey capture. If the random variable X has an Exponential distribution, its distribution function is f(x)=\begin{cases} e^{-x} &amp; x0;;&gt;0\ 0 &amp;  \end{cases}</p>
<p>&lt;<echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=8>&gt;=</p>
<p>Analogous to the discrete distributions, we can define the Expectation and Variance of these distributions by replacing the summation with an integralE[X] = <em>{0}^{}x,f(x),dx =  =  Var[X] = </em>{0}<sup>{}(x-E)</sup>{2},f(x),dx =  </p>
<p>Since the exponential distribution is defined by the rate of occurrence of an event, increasing that rate decreases the time between events. Furthermore since the rate of occurrence cannot be negative, we restrict &gt;0</p>
<p>Example 10. Suppose the time between insect captures X during a summer evening for a species of bat follows a exponential distribution with capture rate of =2 insects per minute and therefore the expected waiting time between captures is 1/=1/2 minute. Suppose that we are interested in the probability that it takes a bat more than 1 minute to capture its next insect.</p>
<p>P(X&gt;1)=</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;fig.height=3&gt;&gt;=</p>
<p>We now must resort to calculus to find this area. Or use tables of pre-calculated values. Or use R (remembering that p-functions give the area under the curve to the left of the given value.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;=</p>
<p>1.5.3 Normal Distribution</p>
<p>Undoubtably the most important distribution in statistics is the normal distribution. If my RV X is normally distributed with mean  and standard deviation  , its probability density function is given byf(x)= where  is the exponential function e^{y} . We could slightly rearrange the function to</p>
<p>f(x)=[-()^{2}]</p>
<p>and see this distribution is defined by its expectation E[X]= and its variance Var[X]=^{2} . Notice I could define it using the standard deviation  , and different software packages will expect it to be defined by one or the other. R defines the normal distribution using the standard deviation.</p>
<p>echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=8</p>
<p>Example 11. It is known that the heights of adult males in the US is approximately normal with a mean of 5 feet 10 inches (=70 inches) and a standard deviation of =3 inches. Your instructor is a mere 5 feet 4 inches (64 inches). What proportion of the population is shorter than your professor?</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;fig.height=3&gt;&gt;=</p>
<p>Using R you can easily find this</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;fig.height=5&gt;&gt;=</p>
<p>1.5.3.1 Standardizing</p>
<p>Before we had computers that could calculate these probabilities for any normal distribution, it was important to know how to convert a probability statement from an arbitrary N(,^{2}) distribution to a question about a Stanard Normal distribution, which is a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. If we have XN(,^{2}) , thenZ=N(0,1)</p>
<p>You might remember doing something similar in an undergraduate statistics course in order to use a table to look up some probability. From the height example, we calculatez =  =  = -2 note that this calculation shows that he is -2 standard deviations from the mean. Next we look at a table for z=-2.00 . To do this we go down to the -2.0 row and over to the .00 column and find 0.0228 . Only slightly over 2% of the adult male population is shorter!</p>
<p>How tall must a male be to be taller than 80% of the rest of the male population? To answer that we must use the table in reverse and look for the 0.8 value. We find the closest value possible (0.7995) and the z value associated with it is z=0.84 . Next we solve the standardizing equation for x z =  0.84 =  x = 3(0.84)+70 = 72.49; Alternatively we could use the quantile function for the normal distribution (q-function) in R and avoid the imprecision of using a table.</p>
<p>qnorm(.8, mean=0, sd=1)</p>
<p>x = 3(0.8416)+70 = 72.52;</p>
<p>Empirical Rule - It is from the normal distribution that the empirical rule from the previous chapter is derived. If XN(,^{2}) then P(-X+) = P(-1Z1) = P(Z1)-P(Z-1) 0.8413-0.1587 = 0.6826</p>
<p>fig.height=4, fig.width=8, echo=FALSEz &lt;- seq(-3,3,length=1000)</p>
<p>1.6 R Comments</p>
<p>There will be a variety of distributions we’ll be interested in and R refers to them using the following abbreviations</p>
<p>All the probability distributions available in R are accessed in exactly the same way, using a d-function, p-function, q-function, and r-function.</p>
